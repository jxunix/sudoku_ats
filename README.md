# sudoku_ats
This is the project for cs520 programming languages. The project is to implement a sudoku solver in ATS.

I have implemented
1) several get() and set() like functions to manipulate the board,
2) a print() function that display the board,
3) function test(i, j, k, board) that checks if that is allowed to put a token of value k on row i column j,
4) test_board() that checks if a board full of tokens are correct solution indeed.

I have also implemented the solve() function that solves a given sudoku puzzle.

The code is pure ATS up to now.
Other fancy features including animation will be added to the project later on.
